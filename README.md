## The Bottom Line for Recruiters

**Hiring junior talent is usually an investment. With me, it's an immediate asset.**  

1. **I don't just write code; I solve problems.** Functions that bankrupt your cloud budget are avoided.  
2. **I ship to production.** Portfolio contains deployed, secure, and documented solutions.  
3. **I communicate.** I bridge complex backend logic with business goals.

**Ready to prove value.** Open for technical interviews anytime.
