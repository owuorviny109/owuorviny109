**Hiring junior talent is usually an investment. With me, it's an immediate asset.**

Instead of requiring constant hand-holding, I bring a senior-level focus on **business outcomes** and **infrastructure costs**:

1. **I don't just write code; I solve problems.** I understand that a beautiful function is useless if it bankrupts the cloud budget.  
2. **I ship to production.** My portfolio isn't full of "Hello World" apps—it's full of deployed, secure, and documented solutions.  
3. **I communicate.** I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and business goals.

**Let's prove it.** I'm ready for a technical interview anytime.
