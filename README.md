## The Bottom Line for Recruiters

**You have two choices when hiring junior talent:**

1. **The traditional junior** - Needs constant supervision, creates technical debt, slow to deliver
2. **Me** - AWS-certified, business-focused, delivers production-ready code from day one

**I don't just write code - I solve business problems.** My cloud infrastructure skills can save your company thousands in AWS costs. My full-stack capabilities can ship features faster. My security mindset reduces your compliance risk.

**Let's prove it.** I'm ready for a technical interview anytime.
